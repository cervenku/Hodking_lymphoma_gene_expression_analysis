Guide to my project

1) Set working directory to the folder where README is located. ("project")

2) project.Rmd is the main project file. 
 - Since I was working on it partially on my computer and partially on VM, I am not sure which dependencies need to be installed. 
    Perhaps library for probe annotation clariomshumantranscriptcluster.db: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/clariomshumantranscriptcluster.db.html

3) dea_signpost.Rmd contains signpost for the contrasts.

4) Folder "data" should contain PDF file with the original article, .sdrf.txt file and CEL files, which need to be downloaded from here: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6896/?query=%22Hodgkins+lymphoma%22+
